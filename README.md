# Spinning disk design outline
Design outline for pcb and motor choices made for the spinning disk experiment 

# Experiment brief

The spinning disk experiment consists of a weighted disk attached to a DC motor where a voltage is applied causing the disk to move. An encoder is used to read the velocity output and provide the results to the user via an arduino and raspberry pi. A main PCB will be used to control where the inputs and outputs of the experiemnts go and how the work together.
